# Crop-Independent Emissions (CIE): existing and new emit bands, side by side

`emit` writes a second set of bands, prefixed `cie-`, next to its existing output. They describe the same land conversions and carbon pools, but stop **before** anything that depends on what the land became:

- **No destination gate.** A pixel is charged as soon as it lost a source class (forest, natural grassland or pasture) inside the 20-year window, whether or not a destination dataset claims it in the assessment year.
- **No destination-specific factor.** Mineral soil is the full stock at risk. The cropland loss fraction is not applied.
- **No discount.** Each pool is a single undiscounted value. The span split and the 20-year linear discount are left to the consumer.

This makes the `cie-` bands the common input from which any destination- or crop-specific accounting can be derived. The existing bands are one such derivation (see [Deriving the existing bands](#deriving-the-existing-bands-from-cie) below). The code is `emit.get_crop_independent_emissions`.

`{span}` is one of `2000-2005`, `2005-2010`, `2010-2015` and `2015-2020`. A conversion falls in span `(a, b)` when `a < year ≤ b`. The copied bands are duplicated so that the `cie-` set is complete on its own.

## Deriving the existing bands from CIE

Every existing band can be computed from the `cie-` bands. `emit.derive_from_cie` does so, and `jurisdictional_direct` and `statistical` now read their emit inputs through it rather than from the existing bands. The only extra inputs are two lookup tables already in `emit`: the soil loss fraction and the discount weights. Below, `ConversionSource` and `Conversion` refer to the band values in the table above.

**Destination.** Cropland outranks pasture:

- `to_cropland = cie-destination-dataset & (1 | 2)`
- `to_pasture = ¬to_cropland ∧ cie-destination-dataset & 4`

**Conversion.** It fired where `cie-conversion-source ≠ NONE ∧ (to_cropland ∨ to_pasture)`, except pasture to pasture, which is not a conversion. The `conversion` value is the pair of the two: forest to cropland, forest to pasture, natural grassland to cropland, natural grassland to pasture, and pasture to cropland. A pasture-to-pasture pixel appears in neither the per-span pools nor `dropped-emissions`.

**Per-span pools.** Each pool is set only where a conversion fired and `cie-conversion-year` is in the span:

- `vegetation-emissions:{span}` = `cie-vegetation-emissions-undiscounted`
- `soil-emissions:{span}` = `cie-peat-transformation-emissions-undiscounted` + `f(cie-climate-zone)` × `cie-mineral-soil-carbon-at-risk` for a cropland destination
- `soil-emissions:{span}` = `cie-peat-transformation-emissions-undiscounted` for a pasture destination
- `emissions:{span}` = vegetation + soil

Here `f` is the cropland soil loss fraction, 1 − retention (IPCC 2019, Vol 4, Table 5.5; `emit.CLIMATE_ZONE_TO_SOC_RETENTION_FRACTION`).

**Occupation.** Each band is gated on its destination only:

- `cropland-peatland-occupation` = `cie-peat-occupation-emissions` where `to_cropland`
- `pastureland-peatland-occupation` = `cie-peat-occupation-emissions` where `to_pasture`

**Discounted values.** Both use the span weights `w` = 0.0125, 0.0375, 0.0625 and 0.0875, which sum to 0.2 (`emit.SPAN_TO_LINEAR_DISCOUNT_WEIGHT`):

- `emissions-per-hectare` = Σ<sub>span</sub> `w` × `emissions:{span}` + both occupation bands
- `dropped-emissions` = Σ<sub>span</sub> `w` × `cie-vegetation-emissions-undiscounted`, where there is a source, the year is in the span, and neither `to_cropland` nor `to_pasture` holds

The vegetation, soil and year identities are unit-tested in `jdluc/__tests__/emit_test.py` (`test_cie_*`), and `test_derive_from_cie_reproduces_every_band_it_replaces` checks every existing band against `derive_from_cie` on a grid covering each event, destination and soil case. `tools/compare-emit-layers.py` checks the vegetation and year identities on a real tile, and the largest difference between each existing band and its derived counterpart. It also totals the old and new pools by source, and by whether a conversion fired, which shows how much carbon the CIE bands carry that the existing bands leave uncharged.

## Encoding

- Every band is float32 with NaN as no-data, including the enum and bitmask bands (`geo.unify_dtype_and_no_data`).
- Bands share the tile's 30 m grid. The units follow the band name after the first `:`.
- Adding the `cie-` bands takes each tile from 20 bands to 30. The `emit` cache version is 2.

## Not yet covered

- **Assessment year.** It is fixed at 2020 (`emit.ASSESSMENT_YEAR`), which sets the lookback window and the destination predicates.
- **Continent.** There is no source dataset yet, so `cie-continent` is empty.
- **Land cover at the start of the window.** There is no band for it. A forest bit would need a year-2000 tree-cover extent, which is not currently ingested.
